# Worktree-specific Caddy configs go here
# Files in this directory are gitignored (except this file)

# These are auto-generated by setup-worktree.sh when DEV_DOMAIN is set.

# Example (for DEV_DOMAIN=fef.dev):

#   https://feature-x.fef.dev {
#       reverse_proxy /api/* host.docker.internal:8001
#       reverse_proxy host.docker.internal:3001
